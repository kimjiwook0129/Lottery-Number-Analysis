## 1. Introduction

I believe most of us have, at least once, dreamed about winning a lottery.

------------ **Write some stuffs here** ------------

I decided to collect lottery data from the past years and use them for some purposes:

- Analysis on the numbers
- Number Prediction

The lottery data used in this project is South Korea's biggest lottery **Lotto 6/45**.

Since the lottery systems all differ throughout the nations, I cannot cover your data collection as well. But only with your data collected properly, the analysis can be done just with the number of number types, and the total numbers to match.
